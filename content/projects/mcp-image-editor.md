## Description

Team project developed during the Hugging Face hackathon focused on Model Context Protocol (MCP). This collaborative image editor leverages MCP capabilities to provide intelligent image editing functionalities, combining traditional image processing with modern AI technologies.

### Development Team

Collaborative team of three developers working together on all aspects of the project:
- **Rafael Jaime**
- **Roberto** 
- **Juan Jos√© (JayJay)**

### Technologies Used

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** - Core protocol for component communication
- **Hugging Face** - AI models platform and tools
- **Gradio** - Interactive web interface for the application
- **OpenCV-Python** - Computer vision library for image processing
- **LangChain** - Framework for language model applications
- **Pillow (PIL)** - Python image processing library
- **FastMCP** - Fast implementation of MCP protocol
- **OpenAI** - Language models for intelligent features

### Hackathon Results

- Successful implementation of MCP protocol in image editing context
- Development of intuitive interface combining traditional tools with AI
- Effective demonstration of real-time collaboration
- Seamless integration between multiple AI and image processing technologies

### Learnings and Technologies Explored

- Deep dive into Model Context Protocol and its applications
- Integration of multiple image processing libraries
- Collaborative development under hackathon pressure
- Performance optimization for real-time processing
- Conversational interface design for technical tasks
