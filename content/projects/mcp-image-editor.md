## Description

Team project developed during the Hugging Face hackathon focused on Model Context Protocol (MCP). This collaborative image editor leverages MCP capabilities to provide intelligent image editing functionalities, combining traditional image processing with modern AI technologies.

### Development Team

Collaborative team of three developers working together on all aspects of the project:
- **Rafael Jaime**
- **Roberto** 
- **Juan Jos√© (JayJay)**

### Technologies Used

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** - Core protocol for component communication
- **Hugging Face** - AI models platform and tools
- **Gradio** - Interactive web interface for the application
- **OpenCV-Python** - Computer vision library for image processing
- **LangChain** - Framework for language model applications
- **Pillow (PIL)** - Python image processing library
- **FastMCP** - Fast implementation of MCP protocol
- **OpenAI** - Language models for intelligent features

### Key Features

- **Intelligent Image Editing**: Uses AI to suggest and apply automatic edits
- **Collaborative Interface**: Enables multiple users working on the same project
- **MCP Integration**: Complete implementation of Model Context Protocol
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant visualization of changes and edits
- **Multiple Filters and Effects**: Wide range of traditional editing tools
- **Conversational AI**: Chat interface for natural language editing commands

### Implemented Functionalities

- Image loading and saving in multiple formats
- Basic and advanced OpenCV filters
- Intelligent resizing and cropping
- Automatic color and brightness correction
- Object detection and enhancement
- Conversational interface for text-based editing commands
- Change history system with undo/redo functionality

### Hackathon Results
