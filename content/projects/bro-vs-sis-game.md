## Description

"Bro VS SiS Game" is an action-packed competitive game developed using Godot Engine. This project represents a complete remake of the original concept, featuring enhanced gameplay mechanics and improved graphics. The game focuses on sibling rivalry through fun and engaging competitive gameplay elements.

**Designed for Reinforcement Learning**: The game is specifically designed to serve as a training environment for reinforcement learning models, allowing AI agents to learn how to play through interaction with the game environment.

### Technologies Used

- Godot Engine
- GDScript
- Godot RL Agents (Reinforcement Learning)
- 2D Game Development
- Game Physics
- Audio System
- User Interface Design
- Scene Management
- Machine Learning / AI

### Reinforcement Learning

This game utilizes the [Godot RL Agents](https://github.com/edbeeching/godot_rl_agents) library that enables the integration of reinforcement learning algorithms directly into Godot Engine. Players can train their own AI models to learn how to play the game, creating intelligent agents that improve their performance through experience.

#### RL Features:
- Customizable training environment
- Integration with popular ML libraries
- Multi-agent training capabilities
- Real-time game state observation
- Configurable reward system
- Trained model export functionality
